# Passport Camera

This is a minimal Vite + React front-end app. The main page has a large button with a camera icon. When clicked, it opens the device camera, lets the user take a photo, sends the photo to an API, and displays the returned info below the button.

## Usage

1. Run the app:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:5173).
3. Click the big camera button to take a photo and see the API response.

## Customization
- Replace the API endpoint in `src/App.jsx` with your actual API URL.
- The camera icon is a placeholder SVG in `src/assets/camera.svg`.
